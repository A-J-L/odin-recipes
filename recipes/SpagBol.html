    <p>Spaghetti Bolognese is a dish consisting of spaghetti pasta served with a meat-based sauce called Bolognese sauce. The Bolognese sauce is typically a slow-cooked sauce made with ground beef, tomatoes, onions, and other ingredients. It's a popular dish in many parts of the world, although the traditional Italian version, rag√π alla bolognese, is usually served with flat pasta like tagliatelle.

        <li>1 <b>onion</b>, diced</li>
        <li>2 <b>garlic cloves</b>, chopped</li>
        <li>100g/3.5 oz <b>carrot</b>, grated</li>
        <li>2 x 400g tins <b>chopped tomatoes</b></li>
        <li>400ml/14fl oz <b>stock</b> (made from <b>stock</b> cube. Ideally beef, but any will do)</li>
        <li>400g/14oz dried <b>spaghetti</b></li>
        <li>salt and pepper</li>
    </ul>  
        
    <h2>Method</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a large saucepan over a medium heat. Add a tablespoon of olive oil and once hot add the beef mince and a pinch of salt and pepper. Cook the mince until well browned over a medium-high heat (be careful not to burn the mince. It just needs to be a dark brown colour). Once browned, transfer the mince to a bowl and set aside.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Add another tablespoon of oil to the saucepan you browned the mince in and turn the heat to medium. Add the onions and a pinch of salt and fry gently for 5-6 minutes, or until softened and translucent. Add the garlic and cook for another 2 minutes. Add the grated carrot then pour the mince and any juices in the bowl back into the saucepan.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Add the tomatoes to the pan and stir well to mix. Pour in the stock, bring to a simmer and then reduce the temperature to simmer gently for 45 minutes, or until the sauce is thick and rich. Taste and adjust the seasoning as necessary.</li>
        <br>
        <li>When ready to cook the spaghetti, heat a large saucepan of water and add a pinch of salt. Cook according to the packet instructions. Once the spaghetti is cooked through, drain and add to the pan with the bolognese sauce. Mix well and serve.</li>
